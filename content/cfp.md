The 2026 Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) seeks your own spins of four
interesting model transformation problems. The deadline for solution
descriptions is **April 14**, immediately followed by a round of
open peer reviewing. As in previous editions, solution descriptions will
be published in a post-proceedings volume, and lead to continued
collaboration for producing a per-case journal article.

### About TTC

The aim of this event is to compare the expressiveness, the usability
and the performance of graph, model and program transformation tools
along a number of selected case studies. A deeper understanding of the
relative merits of different tool features will help to further improve
transformation tools and to indicate open problems.

This contest is the seventeenth of its kind (after an AGTiVE 2007 session,
as GraBaTs 2008 and 2009 contests, and the TTC 2010, 2011, 2013\--2025
contests). For the eighth time, the contest is co-located with several
leading software engineering conferences as part of the [Software
Technologies: Applications and
Foundations](https://conf.researchr.org/home/staf-2026) (STAF)
federation. Teams from the major international research groups in the
development and use of transformation tools are expected to participate
in the TTC again.

### Participating in the Contest

The following case studies have been selected:

- [Program abstraction by transformation: Abstraction of Visual Basic to
  UML](/2023/TTC_2023_paper_1.pdf) ([Resources](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7801435)).
- The Families to Persons Case --- Revisited (link to come)
- [Any of the older cases (see below)](/cases/)

The case description, supporting resources, and discussion between
solution developers are hosted at the source code repositories linked to
above.

If you would like to participate in the contest, you are now asked to
take your favourite transformation tool and submit your solutions. A
submission should consist of a paper and the actual solution (i.e.,
programs, models, etc.). The paper should include a description of the
chosen case study variant (if any) and a presentation of the chosen
solution, including a discussion of design decisions. Examples can be
explored at the [TTC 2021
website](/2021/).

Solutions should be submitted via
[Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=staf2026) by **April 14**. Before the same deadline, each case study solution (tool, project files, documentation) should be made available for review and
demonstration via a public version control repository (e.g. on Github or
Bitbucket). [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) images would be highly
appreciated as well. The paper describing the solution should be in the CEURart LaTeX document class
(see [here](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html#CEURART)) in the single-column workshop format and not
exceeding 10 pages (excluding references and appendices).

Immediately after the submission deadline, please note solution
developers will be asked to participate in a round of *open review* of
other solutions. Therefore, we ask that all solution developers are
available in the period immediately following the submission deadline to participate in these discussions.

### Solutions to older cases

Transformation tools have evolved and continue to evolve, but use cases
of the past are still relevant. To foster a culture of
community-accepted benchmarks, the TTC now also accepts submissions that
solve older cases. References to prior cases can be found
[here](cases.md). Please note that for solutions to these prior cases,
we expect solution authors to compare their solutions with other
existing solutions.

Submissions of solutions to past cases will undergo the same peer-review
process as solutions to the selected case from this year, but there will not be an open peer review. We will
try to have the solution submission reviewed by of the original case authors or original solution authors.

### Publication Procedure

For TTC 2026 there will be several publication opportunities:

- There will be formal contest proceedings. Solution submitters have to
  consider and address the opponents\' statements. The resulting
  solution papers will be reviewed by the TTC program committee. A
  selection of revised solution papers together with the case
  descriptions will be published in the contest proceedings.
- Cases were reviewed by a steering committee, judging the suitable
  publication venues, significance of the problem statement, and
  appropriateness of the evaluation methodology. This feedback was
  passed on to case authors to allow the case to be improved, with the
  aim to facilitate a thorough comparison of the state-of-the-art in
  model transformation, which may be submitted to one of the following
  journals after the workshop:
  - [The International Journal on Software and Systems Modeling
    (SoSyM)](https://www.sosym.org/)
  - [The Journal of Object Technology (JOT)](http://www.jot.fm/)
  - [The International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer
    (STTT)](https://www.springer.com/journal/10009)

For solutions to past cases, the journal publishing option is usually only available if there was no previous journal article about this case.
